As a &#8216;mobile first&#8217; digital product designer (how wan*y does that sound?!?) it&#8217;s much easier said than done to experience the web as a lot of your users will do &#8211; on a mobile device.

Those of us that sit on our lovely MacBook Pros making websites will always struggle to design with the reduced viewport first&#8230; Having been through the process, there really is such a huge difference in your thought and design process if you are truly designing for our portrait pals rather than just amending a desktop design reduced to fit&#8230;

As such, i am going to spend the next week, with my browser permanently resized to a mobile width.

I&#8217;ll let you know what i learn and if it helps think a little bit differently

Oh &#8211; and before anyone says it &#8211; i realise that i am not getting the full mobile experience (touch, location, camera etc) &#8211; but it might be better than nothing&#8230; it might be rubbish
