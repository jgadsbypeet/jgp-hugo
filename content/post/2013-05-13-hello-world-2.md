This project was for my girlfriend&#8217;s Christmas present. We both have an unhealthy obsession with Doctor Who frankly, and the shape in the background says Viki and Jasmine in Galifreyan, the Doctor&#8217;s native language. For those that don&#8217;t know, Jasmine is our tiny little kitty, who also features in the illustration!
